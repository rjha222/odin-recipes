    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

   
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour
<li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>½ cup shortening</li>
<li>1 cup butter</li>  
<li>2 cups white sugar</li>  
<li>5 eggs</li>
<li>2 tablespoons rum, or amount desired</li>
<li>2 teaspoons Key lime juice</li>
<li>1 tablespoon grated Key lime zest</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>¼ cup white sugar</li>  
<li>¼ cup butter</li>  
<li>2 tablespoons Key lime juice</li>
<li>3 tablespoons rum</li>


   
    <h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    
<li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan.</li>
<li> Stir the flour and baking powder together in a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Cream the shortening with 1 cup butter and 2 cups sugar in a large mixing bowl until light colored and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time until mixture is light colored. Stir in 2 tablespoons rum, 2 teaspoons Key lime juice, Key lime zest, and vanilla extract until thoroughly blended. Stir in the flour mixture alternating with the milk. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
<li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 90 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, make the glaze by creaming 1/4 cup sugar with 1/4 cup butter in a small saucepan until light colored and fluffy. Stir in 2 tablespoons Key lime juice until evenly blended. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and stir in 3 tablespoons rum.</li>
<Cool the cake in its pan for 10 minutes. Turn out onto a wire rack or serving plate. While the cake is still warm, use a toothpick to prick the top in many places. Pour the glaze evenly over the top of the cake so it drizzles down all sides. Cool the cake completely before serving.</li>
